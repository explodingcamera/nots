    🚀 <strong>Streamlined Orchestration for Stateless Applications</strong><br>
    🛠 <strong>Ideal for everything from quick scripts to large-scale projects</strong>
</p>

<br>

With `nots`, you can deploy:
- Code from any Git repository
- Tarballs generated by your CI server
- Docker images
- That fresh `a_random_project.ts` you just coded

Get up and running in seconds, with zero downtime during updates.

## 🛠 Usage
### On Your Server

## 🏗 Supported Runtimes
- **Docker Containers:** anything that can run with `docker run`
- **Binaries:** Provide a URL and Nots downloads and runs it as a service
- **Bun:** From serverless functions to full-fledged backend services
- more coming soon

## Why
* Docker images are overkill; lockfiles exist for a reason. Run code without rebuilding entire environments.
* Current open-source FaaS/Serverless solutions are lacking. Skip the new framework learning curve.
* Sometimes, a single-file script is all you need.
* Most projects don't require massive scale. A simple SQLite database and a few endpoints usually suffice.
